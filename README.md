       Download and unzip all files(.tst, .csv and .pkl, 11 files in total) to the same folder in step 1.  
step 3.Run main.py  
step 4.For reproducing tables and figures, run plot.py after step 3.  

Notice: If you want to start from data preprocessing, in step 2, you only need to extract movies.csv, movie_titles.csv, ratings.csv and combined_data_1.txt to the same folder.  
        It's time consuming.  
        movies.csv and ratings.csv come from MovieLens dataset. movie_titles.csv and combined_data_1.txt come from Netflix Prize dataset.
